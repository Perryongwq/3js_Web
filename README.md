# React Three Fiber/Three.js

## Getting Started with this project
- Run 'npm i' to install the node modules
- Run npm start once the modules have installed

## Notes
This is a basic project to get you up and running. Here are some suggestions on how you can improve:
- Add custom fonts
- Make responsive
- Add better shadows (play around with lighting and element positions, what can cast/receive shadows etc...)
- Make the canvas background change colour on scroll
- Make multi page using Routers (play with animating things in and out)
